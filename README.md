### Process Overview

### Network Analysis

**Methods**

- 1.) Create a graph where points represent users and lines represent conversations (tweets)
- 2.) Nodes are grouped into communities based on the frequency of their interactions with other users (mentions, replies)
- 3.) For each community, extract the keywords that define it using TF-IDF
- 4.) Hand Label the communities

**Labels**

-  bernie delegates, progressives who are talk about a politicla revolution. Anti-war, justice and unity
-  Women, Mothers, Black, talk about michelle obama
-  Mainstreams anchors hournalists hosts, mostly at CNN
-  guys, fathers, dads, professionals in news media who are conservatives and talk about hillary
-  mothers moms 
-  religious conservatives
-  journalists talking about the DNC chair debbie wazzerman shultz
-  Hispanic and Latinx Persons
-  authors and writers
-  news people
-  conservatives talking about donna brazille and implicating corruption, talking about wikileaks
-  Religious males (husbands) who work in media (radio
-  Muslim Persons 
-  Reporterrs
-  latina, teenages, 'don't give a ****'
- talking about mental illness and demi lovato (?)


### Network Graph

### KMeans Clustering

**Methods**

- 1.) Using a pre-trained word2vec model trained on 2 billion tweets (stanford), vectorize text data (aka turn the words into a numerical representation)
-     ex: King - Man + Woman = Queen
- 2.) Use K-Means algorithm to group users that use similar language together
- 3.) Label each user with their assigned cluster
- 4.) Hand Label the clusters using topic modeling
- 5.) Reduce dimensions to vizualize the clusters in 2d

**Labels**
- Custer 1 :Talking about Debbie Wasserman Shultz (unfavorably)
- Custer 2 :Women discussing womenâ€™s issues
- Custer 3 :Expressing concern about trump with the nuclear codes
- Custer 4 :Talking about love, God, good vibes
- Custer 5 :Watching the debate with friends, supporting Hillary Clinton
- Custer 6 :Proud Americans
- Custer 7 :Conservative sports fans
- Custer 8 :Barack and Michelle Obama fans
- Custer 9 :Barack and Michelle Obama fans
- Custer 10 :Young people, Bernie Sanders supporters
